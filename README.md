# Extended Essay
Here, you can find all of the programs used in the research for my IB Extended Essay on Artificial Neural Networks in the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST library.


## NOTICE
Not all files could be included in this repo.  Specifically, the MNIST dataset and the data produced when this program was run were unable to be inculded due to their size.  As such, in order to run this program, you must follow these instructions.

### Obtaining Generated Data


### Downloading MNIST dataset
The copy of the MNIST dataset I used has been provided by Michael Nielsen provided at [this repo] (https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning.git).  However, as this link or file may be updated, I have included the copy I used as a [download from my Dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93182171/Extended%20Essay/mnist.pkl).  This is solely to ensure that the programming found in this repo is resilient to external changes.
