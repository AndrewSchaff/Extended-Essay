Due to issues that arose during the upload of this repository, the neural network data must be downloaded separately from the rest of the program.  Please use [this link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93182171/Extended%20Essay/Run%2022.zip) to download the data for Run 22.  Run 22.zip contains all of the data produced during the data collection run of this program.  In order to run the program, this file must be unzipped and its contents placed in a folder with the name "Run 22".  The complete directory should look something like this: ./Data/Run 22/
